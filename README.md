# react-nested-file-tree-ts

Inherit react-nested-file-tree
But in case I remove prop types to configure with react 16+ and Typescript

import NestedFileTreeView from 'react-nested-file-tree-ts' for using

#1.0.6 add extra class for file
filetree._contents.push ({
    name: "File name",
    path: "",
    fileClassName: 'new class'
})
